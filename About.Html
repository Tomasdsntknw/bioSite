            <li>
                M: Tell me a little bit about your childhood and where you grew up. 
            
            
                J: I grew up in Dighton, Massachusetts. It's a very small country town. I started riding horses when I was 12 and rode competitively. 
                I was an active softball and volleyball player. 
            </li>

            <li>
                M: Can you also expand a little bit more on the events you competed in while riding horses? 
    
                J: When I actively showed horses, I would show in the equation and pleasure classes and sometimes hunter paces and gymkhana. Equation is based on how your posture and balance look. 
                Pleasure is more focused on the horses and how pleasurable they look to ride. Hunter paces are fast paced trail rides through the woods and based on a timely record of how fast you and your horse can pace. 
                And lastly gymkhana was my favorite because those are fun games classes. Some include barrel racing, pole bending, egg and spoon race and mint Julip classes.

            </li>

            <li>
                M: Can you tell me a little bit more about what a Ranch hand is at Walt Disney World? 
        
                J: We take care of 90-100 of the happiest horses on earth. From Clydesdales to Shetland ponies, we maintain their health and exercise. 
                As a ranch hand, we are trail guides, Cinderella coachmen for the weddings, Main Street trolly drivers and evening carriage ride drivers for a nice sunset ride. 
            </li>

            <li>
                M: Any personal accomplishments? 
        
                J: Getting my bachelor's degree in hospitality management, getting into the Disney college program after being rejected before, and being offered my dream job after being rejected once before. 
            </li>
            
            <li>
                M: Can you expand more on your dream job? What made you want that dream job any obstacles getting there? 

	            J: I've wanted this job as a ranch hand for a few years now. When I was a front desk agent at the all-star resorts, I went on a trail ride and talked to this girl named Kara who worked at the ranch and was my trail guide and told her I wanted to be here so bad. 
                She gave me ideas and tips and when the applications went out I applied right away. I had a riding interview and it went great however with Disney’s transfer system I was not in transfer guidelines so I did not get offered the job. 
                That didn't stop me from trying again so a year later in March of 2020 I applied again but then the pandemic started and we shut down and I thought my application was lost in the cloud. 
                Fast forward to October 2020 I get a call from the ranch offering me a job without interviewing again since they remembered me from last time. I have been there since and Kara is still a good friend to this day. 
                I wanted this job because I grew up riding horses and horses and Disney doesn't get much better. 
                I truly love what I do and that's making Disney magic with our happiest horses on earth.
