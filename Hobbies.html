        <p>Jordan has a strong love for reading, visiting the dog park, and sleeping!
        <br>
        <br>"I started reading in the fall of 2021. I have a good friend who is a huge book nerd who kind of got me started. 
I use to read a ton in high school so it's nice to find that hobby come back. When I'm not reading, I do love to visit the dog park with my boys.
It brings me great joy to see my dogs running around a big yard and playing with each other. Sleeping is always a favorite since I work 2 jobs and sometimes have 18-hour days." 
        </p>

        <p>Any projects you're working on? If you do have projects what sparked those ideas? 
        <br>
        <br>"I got a Cricut for Christmas so I've been playing with it and making shirts, cups, wedding decor etc. 
I wanted to design custom cups and shirts for vacations. It's very time consuming but the outcomes are always awesome."
