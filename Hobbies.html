	            J: Reading, riding horses, and sleeping!

	            J: I also started reading in the fall of 2021. I have a good friend who is a huge book nerd who kind of got my started. 
                I use to read a ton in high school so it's nice to find that hobby come back. 
                Sleeping is always a favorite since I work 2 jobs and sometimes have 18-hour days. 
                The weekends is when I catch up on that.

                M: Any projects you're working on? If you do have projects what sparked those ideas? 

                J: I got a Cricut for Christmas so I've been playing with it and making shirts, cups, wedding decor etc. 
                I wanted to design custom cups and shirts for vacations. It's very time consuming but the outcomes are always awesome.
